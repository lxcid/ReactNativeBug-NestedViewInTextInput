<!-- Describe your issue in detail. -->

There were a few similar issues before this one that got closed by the bot ([facebook/react-native#17467](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/17467) & [facebook/react-native#17468](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/17468)) because it's missing information or went stale. The author open a [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48033885/how-to-insert-custom-emoji-small-pictures-into-textinput-of-react-native) that did not get answer.

Here's my attempt to provide a more complete argument and be as informative as possible to help push this feature request/bug fix forward.

I'm aware that `<TextInput />` uses `SpannableString` in Android and `NSAttributedString` in iOS underneath, both are capable of inlining image (Android with `ImageSpan` and iOS with `NSTextAttachment`). But this is not supported by React Native as of `v0.54.2`.

To be specific, I'm talking about `<Image />` nested within `<Text />` nested within `<TextInput multiline />`.

## Environment

## Steps to Reproduce

<!-- 
  Required. Let us know how to reproduce the issue. Include a code sample, share a project, 
  or share an app that reproduces the issue using [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/).
-->

A react native project have been created at [lxcid/ReactNativeBug-NestedViewInTextInput](https://github.com/lxcid/ReactNativeBug-NestedViewInTextInput). You can pull it down locally and launch the project with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.

## Expected Behavior

<!-- Write what you thought would happen. -->

At minimum, I would hope for `<TextInput>` + `<Text>` + `<Image>` to work as expected in iOS and Android.

## Actual Behavior

<!-- Write what happened. Include screenshots if needed. If this is a regression, let us know. -->

### Text + Image

First of all, `<Text />` do support nested images, even though its not well documented. There might be some rendering differences between iOS and Android, but they are generally supported.

### Text + View

As for nested views in `<Text />`, only iOS is supported. This is documented [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text.html#nested-views-ios-only).

### TextInput + Image

Surprisingly, for `<Image />` nested within `<Text />` nested within `<TextInput />`, It worked for Android but not so much for iOS, which did not display the image.

### TextInput + View

As for nested views in `<TextInput />`, Android crashes while iOS does not display the image.

### Summary

I create a table to summarize and compare what we have observed here:

|              Components              | Android | iOS |
| :----------------------------------: | :-----: | :-: |
|         `<Text>` + `<Image>`         |   ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ  |
|         `<Text>` + `<View>`          |   üí•    | ‚úÖ  |
| `<TextInput>` + `<Text>` + `<Image>` |   ‚úÖ    | ‚ùå  |
|  `<TextInput>` +`<Text>` + `<View>`  |   üí•    | ‚ùå  |
